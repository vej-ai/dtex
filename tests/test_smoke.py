"""THE simpl.E smoke test — the executable specification of the engine's job.

This file defines, in runnable code, *exactly* what the engine must do. Build
stages 1-4 had no engine, so every smoke run was wired by hand inside
``_drive_one_run`` — the "STAGE 5 SEAM". Stage 5 built the engine
(:mod:`simple_e.engine`), and that hand-wiring has now **collapsed**: the seam
is a single :func:`simple_e.run` call.

What the run does, end to end (docs/02 §Run lifecycle, docs/05 §1):

    open → read_state → [ensure_schema → write_batch ...]* → commit_state → close

It drives the ``echo`` fixture source (an ``append`` stream ``events`` and a
``merge`` + ``incremental`` stream ``items``) into the pre-baked DuckDB
destination, and the assertions pin down the contract the engine must satisfy:

* rows land in DuckDB, in the right tables, with the right values;
* ``_simple_e_synced_at`` is populated on every row;
* ``_simple_e_state`` carries the incremental stream's advanced cursor;
* a second run *resumes from committed state* — the incremental stream yields
  only new rows, the append stream re-runs in full.

"""det — a simple, open-source Python extract-load (EL) tool.

det moves data from a **source** into a **destination** and nothing more.
Pipelines are configs, connectors are folders of plain Python; projects are
folders of plain files run from the ``det`` CLI or the importable ``det``
library. Architectural inspiration is dbt.

This module is the **public API** a connector author imports. After build
stage 3 it exposes the decorator surface a connector body binds to —
``stream``, ``resource``, ``destination``, ``Connector``, ``stream_method`` —
plus the contract types an author references (``Capability``, ``Schema``,
``Field``, ``Config``, ``State``, ``Cursor``, ``Batch``, ``StateRecord`` and
the enums). A connector body should need to import only from ``det``::

    from det import stream, destination, Capability, Schema

As of build stage 5 it also exposes the engine entry point :func:`run` — the
library front door onto the run lifecycle (docs/02 §The triad). The CLI is a
thin shell over this same function. Stage 8.B made *configs* the runtime
unit — a config (``configs/<name>.yml``) names one source-to-destination
pipeline; ``run`` takes the config's name::

    import det
    result = det.run(config="shiphero_prod")

``run`` returns a :class:`~det.types.RunResult` and never raises on a
connector/destination failure (docs/07 §4.1).

"""The run loop — the 6-stage run lifecycle (docs/02 §Run lifecycle).

This module is the engine's keystone: :func:`run` executes one synchronous pass
of the lifecycle docs/02 fixes — DISCOVER → RESOLVE → INIT DEST → LOAD STATE →
RUN STREAMS → RUN RECORD — and returns a :class:`~simple_e.types.RunResult`.

The destination hooks are driven in the exact order docs/03 §3.4 / docs/05 §1
fix::

    open → read_state → [ensure_schema → write_batch ...]* → commit_state → close

Locked decisions honored here:

* **Per-stream state commit** — a stream's cursor is committed via
  ``commit_state`` *immediately* after that stream's batches durably land. A
  later stream failing does not lose an earlier stream's progress, and a re-run
  resumes correctly (docs/02 §Commit granularity).
* **Sequential streams** — streams run one at a time in declared order
  (docs/02 §Concurrency model, v1).
* **Schema evolution default ``evolve``** — a stream with no declared schema has
  one inferred from its first batch; a ``strict`` stream whose first batch
  diverges from its declared schema fails the run *before* ``ensure_schema``.
* **``close`` always runs** — in a ``finally``, even on failure, but only when
  ``open`` succeeded (docs/05 §1).

``run`` never raises on a connector or destination failure: it returns a
``RunResult`` with ``status=FAILED`` and a populated ``error`` (docs/07 §4.1).

    This is the engine. The CLI and the library both call it (it is re-exported

    1. **DISCOVER** — find the project root (``project_dir`` or walk up for
       ``simple_e_project.yml``); resolve the source connector and its bound
       destination, project-local beating baked (docs/03 §5).
    2. **RESOLVE** — merge every config layer into a frozen :class:`RunConfig`
       and immutable per-connector :class:`Config` objects (docs/03 §6).
    3. **INIT DEST** — bind the destination hooks, fix the capability tier via
       ``capabilities()``, ``open`` the connection.
    4. **LOAD STATE** — ``read_state`` the prior :class:`StateRecord` set,
       indexed by stream name.
    5. **RUN STREAMS** — for each selected stream in declared order: build its
       context, resolve its schema, ``ensure_schema``, drive the generator and
       ``write_batch`` each batch, then ``commit_state`` *that stream's* record
       immediately (per-stream commit — docs/02 §Commit granularity).
    6. **RUN RECORD** — build and return the :class:`RunResult`; ``close`` the
       destination in a ``finally``.

    Parameters:

    * ``connector`` — the source connector NAME to run.
    * ``target`` — the ``profiles.yml`` target; falls back to the project's
      ``default_target`` (docs/06).
    * ``project_dir`` — the project root, or a directory under it to walk up
      from; defaults to the current working directory.
    * ``full_refresh`` — when ``True``, incremental cursors ignore prior state
      and re-extract from the beginning (docs/03 §3.2).
    * ``select`` — run only this subset of streams (empty ⇒ all).
    * ``params`` / ``**kwargs`` — per-invocation source param overrides, the
      highest precedence layer (docs/03 §6); ``kwargs`` is the keyword-argument
      convenience form, merged under ``params``.
    * ``destination_params`` — per-invocation overrides for the *destination*
      connector's config (e.g. DuckDB's ``path``), highest precedence on the
      destination side.

    Never raises on a connector/destination failure: returns a ``RunResult``

"""Meta Marketing API source — two @streams walking (account × date window).

Both streams share one extraction loop (``_walk``):

* Resolve the walk floor: ``max(cursor - lookback_days, start_date)`` when
  a cursor exists, else ``start_date`` (virgin run = the backfill).
* Walk ``[floor, today]`` in inclusive windows of ``window_days``,
  oldest -> newest; inside each window loop every configured ad account,
  run one ASYNC Insights report job (``time_increment=1``, the stream's
  ``level`` / ``breakdowns``) and page its result — see client.py for why
  sync GETs are not used.
* Yield batches per page; after EVERY account of a window has been fully
  yielded, ``cursor.observe(window_end)``. The engine may flush cursor
  state after any durable batch write, so a day observed before its rows
  left our buffer could be committed as "done" without its data.

Streams:

* ``ads_insights`` — level=ad, no breakdown, merge on
  (date_start, account_id, ad_id).
* ``insights_hourly`` — level=campaign, breakdown
  ``hourly_stats_aggregated_by_advertiser_time_zone``, merge on
  (date_start, hour, account_id, campaign_id). The hour is in the AD
  ACCOUNT's timezone, so each account's ``timezone_name`` /
  ``timezone_offset_hours_utc`` is fetched ONCE per run
  (``GET /act_<id>?fields=timezone_name,timezone_offset_hours_utc``) and
  stamped on every row. Each stream has its own cursor, and per-stream
  ``params:`` in the config (window_days / start_date) size its backfill
  independently.

Today is included on purpose: it is partial, and the next run's lookback
re-pull (28 days by default — Meta's longest attribution restatement
window) overwrites it via merge on the natural grain. The same re-pull
absorbs late conversions and deleted/rejected-ad removals for recent
days; a restatement older than the lookback is only caught by a manual
re-pull (one-shot ``since:`` under streams:, or ``dtex state reset``).

A window whose async job keeps ending ``Job Failed`` / ``Job Skipped`` is
BISECTED: Meta sheds load this way for reports it deems too large, the
job fails before any page is fetched (nothing has been yielded), so the
sub-window is simply re-requested narrower. A 1-day window that still
fails is a real error and raises.

Every (window, account) is logged with its row + page counts and the
account's usage-header percentage — a silent run is a bug, not a feature.

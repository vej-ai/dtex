"""GraphQL query strings for each ShipHero stream — docs/04 "schema.py" role.

One constant per declared stream. Ported verbatim from the v2 reference's
`config.json` `tables.*.query` fields (with `orders` and `products` filled in
from the public ShipHero schema in the same shape). Keeping the query strings
in their own module — distinct from `source.py` (the @stream entry points) and
`client.py` (HTTP plumbing) — matches the docs/04 file-layout convention that
"shaping logic" lives alongside the body but not inside it.

Each query takes four variables:

* ``$first: Int``         — page size
* ``$after: String``      — opaque GraphQL cursor (the previous page's endCursor)
* ``$dateFrom: ISODateTime``
* ``$dateTo: ISODateTime``

ShipHero's response shape (and therefore the `FIELD_PATHS` walk used by
`source.py`) is always::

    {"data": {"<stream>": {"data": {"edges": [{"node": {...}}, ...],
                                    "pageInfo": {"hasNextPage": ..., "endCursor": ...}}}}}

The `*` wildcard in a field path means "for every element of this list, yield
its element" — that is how `source.extract_records` unwraps the `edges` array
into one node-dict per row.

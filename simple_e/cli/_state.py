"""Incremental-state inspection + reset for ``simple-e state``.

simpl.E keeps incremental state in the destination's ``_simple_e_state`` table
(docs/05 §5). The CLI never owns state — it borrows the destination's own
hooks:

* **list** — opens the destination via its ``@destination.open`` hook and calls
  the ``@destination.read_state`` hook. Fully abstract: any Tier-A destination
  works, the CLI never touches SQL.
* **reset** — opens the destination the same way, then issues a targeted
  ``DELETE FROM _simple_e_state``. This is the one place the CLI reaches past
  the hook contract.

  # NOTE: there is no ``delete_state`` / ``reset_state`` hook in the
  # destination contract (docs/03 §3.4 / docs/05 §1) — the engine never needed
  # one. Adding one is an engine change, and the task says the CLI is a thin
  # shell with NO new engine logic. So ``reset`` does the cleanest thing
  # available: it executes a parameterized DELETE on the connection the
  # destination's ``open`` hook returns. That assumes a SQL-ish destination
  # exposing a ``conn.conn.execute(sql, params)`` cursor and a
  # ``_simple_e_state`` table — true for DuckDB, the only Tier-A destination
  # shipped in v1 (docs/05 §2). A non-SQL destination would need the engine
  # hook; reset fails cleanly (caught by the CLI) rather than silently. This
  # is an accepted v1 limitation, flagged here rather than hidden.

This module resolves the destination through the engine's *public* discovery +
config surface — it never re-implements discovery.

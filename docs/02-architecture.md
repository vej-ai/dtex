## The triad: engine / library / project

simpl.E borrows dbt's separation between *the tool* and *the work*. There are
three things, and keeping them distinct keeps the system simple.

| Component | dbt analogue | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **Engine** | `dbt-core` internals | Discovery, config resolution, the run lifecycle, state, the run record. |
| **Library** | importable `dbt` | `from simple_e import run` — programmatic entry, equal to the CLI. |
| **CLI** | the `dbt` binary | `simple-e run -c <name>` / `--tag <tag>`. A thin shell over the library. |
| **Baked connectors** | dbt's built-in macros | Connector folders shipped *inside* `simple_e`. |
| **Project** | a dbt project | User-owned folder: `simple_e_project.yml`, `profiles.yml`, `connectors/`. |

The CLI and the library are **the same engine** with two front doors. `simple-e
run` parses argv and calls the same `run()` the library exposes. Nothing the CLI
can do is unavailable to the library, and vice versa.

> alternative. Pick one before v1 and never alias.]

## Connector resolution: baked vs custom

A connector is named, not pathed. The engine resolves a name by precedence:

1. **Project-local** — `connectors/<name>/` in the user's project. (`"custom"`.)
2. **Baked** — `<name>/` inside the `simple_e` package. (`"meta_ads"`.)

Project-local wins on a name clash, so a user can shadow a baked connector with
their own fork. Resolution produces a **ConnectorHandle**: the folder path, the
parsed `register.yaml`, and the imported decorated callables. Sources and
destinations resolve through the *same* path — they are the same kind of object.

## Run lifecycle

A `simple-e run` (or `simple_e.run()`) is one synchronous pass through a fixed
sequence. It either reaches `commit` and exits `0`, or it fails and exits non-zero.

```
  simple-e run -c custom
        │
        ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 1. DISCOVER    locate project; resolve connector(s) by name/tag  │
  │ 2. RESOLVE     merge simple_e_project.yml + profiles.yml + env +  │
  │                CLI flags  →  one frozen RunConfig                │
  │ 3. INIT DEST   open destination connector; ensure it is ready;   │
  │                determine its capability tier                    │
  │ 4. LOAD STATE  read _simple_e_state from the destination         │
  │                (or its companion state backend — see tiers)     │
  │ 5. RUN STREAMS for each selected stream  (sequential in v1):     │
  │      a. EXTRACT    drive the @stream generator → batches         │
  │      b. NORMALIZE  infer/evolve schema; coerce types per batch   │
  │      c. LOAD       hand normalized batch to the destination      │
  │      d. COMMIT     persist this stream's cursor to state         │
  │ 6. RUN RECORD  write a structured record: per-stream rows, bytes,│
  │                cursor, duration, status; print summary; exit     │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Stages 1–4 are setup; stage 5 is the real work; stage 6 is the audit trail.

- **Discover** — find the project root (walk up for `simple_e_project.yml`),
  then resolve every connector implied by `-c` or `--tag`.
- **Resolve** — config precedence, lowest to highest: connector `register.yaml`
  defaults → `simple_e_project.yml` defaults → `profiles.yml` (active profile) →
  environment variables → CLI flags. The result is a **frozen `RunConfig`** —
  nothing reads ambient config after this point. (The `defaults` + override idea
  is borrowed from Sling's replication YAML.)
- **Init destination** — open the destination connector and confirm it can
  receive writes. This also fixes its **capability tier** (next section), which
  decides where state lives.
- **Load state** — read prior cursors from `_simple_e_state` so incremental
  streams know where they left off. A cold destination simply yields empty state.
- **Run streams** — the loop below.
- **Run record** — a machine-readable record (and a human summary) of what
  happened. This is simpl.E's audit surface; it is *not* a metadata catalog.

### Commit granularity

State is committed **per stream** (step 5d), immediately after that stream's data
is durably written — not once at the end. If stream 7 of 10 fails, streams 1–6
keep their advanced cursors and the next run resumes mid-job. This favors
**crash-safety over whole-run atomicity**, the right trade for synchronous EL.

> [Open question: a `--atomic` flag could defer all cursor commits to step 6 for
> users who want all-or-nothing semantics. Default stays per-stream.]

## The extract → normalize → load pipeline

Every stream flows through three stages. The split is borrowed from dlt and is
the reason memory stays bounded.

```
  @stream generator        normalizer            destination connector
  ┌───────────────┐       ┌───────────────┐      ┌────────────────────┐
  │ yield batch ─ ─┼─────▶ │ infer schema  │      │  write_batch(...)  │
  │ yield batch ─ ─┼─────▶ │ evolve schema ┼────▶ │  ... (tier logic)  │
  │ yield batch ─ ─┼─────▶ │ coerce types  │      │  flush             │
  └───────────────┘       └───────────────┘      └────────────────────┘
        EXTRACT               NORMALIZE                  LOAD
```

- **Extract.** The connector's `@stream` function is a generator. The engine
  *pulls* from it; the generator decides batch size by how much it `yield`s.
- **Normalize.** The engine reconciles each batch against the stream's schema and
  coerces values to the destination's type system. When a stream declares an
  explicit `schema` in `register.yaml` — the **recommended default**, and what
  the ShipHero proof case does — that schema is authoritative. When `schema` is
  omitted, the engine infers it from the first batch and evolves it additively as
  later batches introduce new columns or wider types (a convenience for
  prototyping; see chapter 03 §2.2.1).
- **Load.** The normalized batch is handed to the destination connector, which
  appends/merges/replaces per the configured write disposition.

### How `@stream` generators keep memory bounded

A `@stream` function is a plain Python generator. It does not build a list of all
rows — it **`yield`s a batch and pauses**. The engine consumes that batch
(normalize + load) before requesting the next. Peak memory is therefore *one
batch*, not one dataset, regardless of source size. Sketch:

```python
@stream(name="orders", primary_key="id")
def orders(client, cursor):
    page = cursor.get("last_id", 0)
    while True:
        batch = client.fetch_orders(after=page)   # one page
        if not batch:
            return
        yield batch                               # engine drains this, then resumes
        page = batch[-1]["id"]
```

`@resource` is the simpler form for a connector that produces one logical table
without its own cursor; `@stream` is the incremental-aware form. Both are
generators; both are pulled the same way. (Their full contract — signature,
`register.yaml` declaration, the class escape hatch — is owned by the connector
handbook.)

## Tag-based selection

simpl.E selects work the way dbt does — by **name** or by **tag**.

- `simple-e run -c orders` — run one connector by name.
- `simple-e run --tag hourly` — run every connector whose `register.yaml`
  declares the `hourly` tag.
- Wildcards (`-c "shopify.*"`) select families of streams, the pattern borrowed
  from Sling's wildcard replication.

Tags are declared in each connector's `register.yaml` and resolved at the
**discover** stage into a concrete connector set before anything runs. Selection
is purely a *filter over discovered connectors* — it adds no runtime concept,
which is why it passes the simpl.E test.

## Destination capability tiers

State lives in the destination — but not every destination *can* hold a state
table. Destinations therefore have **capability tiers**, fixed at *init* time:

| Tier | Examples | State storage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Tier A — Stateful warehouse** | BigQuery, Snowflake, Postgres | `_simple_e_state` table *inside the destination* | The simple, default case. One destination, one place for everything. |
| **Tier B — Stateless storage** | S3, GCS, local files | A **companion state backend** alongside the data | Object storage cannot host a queryable state table; a sidecar is required. |

A Tier B destination resolves a companion state backend (declared via the
`@destination.state_backend` hook); the engine routes **load state** / **commit
state** there instead of to the data target. The stream-running logic is
identical across tiers — only the state I/O path differs. The v1 default Tier B
backend is a **sidecar JSON file** (`_simple_e_state.json`) co-located with the
data; the backend interface is pluggable so a transactional store can be added
later without an engine change. (Full detail: *05 — Destinations & State*.)

## Concurrency model

simpl.E's concurrency stance is deliberately minimal — concurrency is the most
reliable place for an EL tool to acquire bugs, so v1 spends its complexity budget
elsewhere.

- **Across streams: sequential.** v1 runs selected streams one at a time, in
  declared order. Output is deterministic; failures are easy to localize;
  per-stream commit (above) already gives resumability without parallelism.
- **Within a stream: pipelined.** Extract, normalize, and load form a producer/
  consumer pipeline. While the destination writes batch *N*, the generator may
  already be producing batch *N+1*. This is bounded-buffer pipelining, not
  unbounded fan-out — peak memory stays a small number of in-flight batches.
- **Where parallelism *could* go later** (documented, not built in v1):
  1. **Independent streams in parallel** — streams touch disjoint cursors and
     (usually) disjoint tables, so a worker pool is natural. Needs a concurrency
     cap and per-destination connection limits.
  2. **Partitioned extract within one stream** — e.g. a date-ranged backfill
     split into sub-ranges. Requires the connector to declare partitionability.

  Both are additive: they change *how fast* step 5 runs, never the lifecycle or
  the contract. v1 ships sequential-across / pipelined-within and stops there.

> [Open question: whether v1 exposes a `--threads N` flag (dbt-style) as a no-op
> placeholder reserving the name, or omits it until parallel streams actually
> ship. Reserving the name avoids a future breaking change.]

## What this document does not own

By design, the architecture references three things specified elsewhere:

- **Connector contract** — the exact `register.yaml` schema, the `@stream` /
  `@resource` signatures, and the class escape hatch.
- **Destinations** — the per-destination write semantics and the Tier B
  companion-backend implementation.
- **CLI** — the full `simple-e` command/flag surface.

The engine's promise to all three is constant: discover them, resolve their
config into a frozen `RunConfig`, drive their generators through extract →
normalize → load, keep state in the destination, and emit a run record.

"""Connector enumeration helpers for the CLI's ``list`` / ``validate`` commands.

The engine's :mod:`simple_e.engine.discovery` resolves a connector *by name*
(:func:`resolve_connector`) and answers "which connectors carry tag X"
(:func:`connectors_with_tag`), but it has no public "enumerate every connector"
call. ``simple-e list`` and ``simple-e validate --all`` need exactly that.

This module supplies that enumeration. It is **not** engine logic — it only
walks the same connector roots the engine's discovery walks, parses each
``register.yaml`` into a :class:`~simple_e.types.ConnectorManifest`, and yields
the result. The parsing is the engine's own
:class:`~simple_e.types.ConnectorManifest.from_dict`; the walking mirrors
:func:`simple_e.engine.discovery.connectors_with_tag` (which is the documented
"filter over discovered connectors"). No data ever moves here.
